# Indian Cricket Team Web Crawler Report

## Abstract

<!-- Provide a concise summary of your project's development, objectives, and next steps. -->

The "**Indian Cricket Team Web Crawler**" project aims to develop a web crawler that extracts data from Wikipedia pages related to the Indian Cricket Team. The project begins by **scraping Wikipedia** to gather information about the team, extracting relevant links, and storing the content in **HTML format** within a directory. Subsequently, an **indexer** processes this data to generate a **JSON file** containing title and content information. Using this indexed data, a **TF-IDF vectorizer** and **cosine similarity model** are constructed.

The project utilizes **Flask** to create a web application where users can input queries. The **cosine similarity model** is employed to compute similarities between the user query and stored documents, allowing the display of **top-k relevant documents** based on the query.

Next steps involve optimizing the **web crawler's efficiency**, refining the **indexing and querying mechanisms**, and enhancing the **user interface** for a seamless experience.
